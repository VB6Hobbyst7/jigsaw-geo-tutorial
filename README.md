A tutorial on unstructured mesh generation for geoscientific modelling, presented at the `18th International Workshop on Multi-scale (Un)-structured mesh Modelling for coastal, shelf and global ocean dynamics:` <a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/international-workshop-on-multi-scale-un-structured-mesh-numerical-modeling-for-coastal-shelf-and-gl/event-summary-d24248221240427887bbbeebea0aae76.aspx">`IMUM-2019`</a>, hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory in Santa Fe, NM. 

This package provides a set of `MATLAB` and `Python` example programs used in the tutorial as well as the accompanying slides. The follow dependencies must be installed to run the examples:

`MATLAB` users:

    * A C++ compiler (g++, clang, msvc, etc).
    * cmake (>= 3.9.4).
    * MATLAB.
    * The jigsaw-matlab package.

`Python` users:

    * A C++ compiler (g++, clang, msvc, etc).
    * cmake (>= 3.9.4).
    * Python 3 (with: numpy, scipy, pathlib).
    * Paraview.
    * The jigsaw-python package.

The tutorial is based on <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw">`JIGSAW`</a>, a Delaunay-based unstructured meshing package optimised for earth system modelling. The `jigsaw-matlab` and `jigsaw-python` packages can be found <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw-matlab">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw-python">here</a>.
