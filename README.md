A tutorial on unstructured mesh generation for geoscientific modelling, presented at the `18th International Workshop on Multi-scale (Un)-structured mesh Modelling for coastal, shelf and global ocean dynamics` (<a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/international-workshop-on-multi-scale-un-structured-mesh-numerical-modeling-for-coastal-shelf-and-gl/event-summary-d24248221240427887bbbeebea0aae76.aspx">`IMUM-2019`</a>), hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory in Santa Fe, NM. 

This package provides the `C++` src for <a href="https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw">`JIGSAW`</a>, a `MATLAB` and `Python` scripting interface, as well as the set of example programs used in the tutorial. The following dependencies will need to be installed.

`MATLAB` users:

    * A C++ compiler (g++, clang, msvc, etc).
    * cmake (>= 3.9.4).
    * MATLAB.

`Python` users:

    * A C++ compiler (g++, clang, msvc, etc).
    * cmake (>= 3.9.4).
    * Python 3 (with: numpy, scipy, pathlib).
    * Paraview.
